## Introduction
Darkroom is a language and compiler for image processing embedded in Terra. It allows to compile program directly into line-buffered pipelines, with all intermediate values in local line-buffer sotrage.

Our group dive into the principle of Darkroom, doing research on the programming model of Darkroom and the strategy of Darkroom to optimize the performance of program in ASIC, FPGA and CPU.
