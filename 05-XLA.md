## Introduction

**XLA** (Accelerated Linear Algebra) is a domain-specific compiler for linear algebra that optimizes TensorFlow computations. The results are improvements in speed, memory usage, and portability on server and mobile platforms. Users can use XLA via JIT(just-in-time) compilation or AOT(ahead-of-time) compilation.

In this project, we will do a small research on XLA, which covers in

* What kind of acceleration can XLA do
* How does XLA do it
* Where does JIT and AOT came in
